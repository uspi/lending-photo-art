# Lending "Photo Art"

## Description

The current project is one page of the site. This is my educational task, during which it was necessary to make up a website using a finished photograph.

After that, it was necessary to make the site responsive using `@media`. I decided to use `Bootstrap` and the page frame for adaptability, and write the rest in `css`.
